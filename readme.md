# Lab09 LINQ and JSON
### Neighborhoods of New York City
## Overview
This app takes in a provided data file (about neighborhoods in NYC in json format) and processes it to print out only the names of unique, named, non-empty neighborhoods.

## Use
The app itself does not really have any use cases, although bits of the architecture could be useful and are usable.

## Architecture
Because of the straightforward nature of the requirements, the architecture is simple.
1. Use system IO to find the datafile and read it in as a string
2. Use Newtonsoft to parse the JSON into a object that is queryable
3. Use LINQ to query the object according to specifications
3b. Do all of those queries one and a time and all at once
4. Iterate across those results and print them to the console

There are no unit tests for this app.
